# charRNN pre-trained models

This directory contains a small collection of pre-trained models for use with the `ml5.charRNN()`. Instructions for how to train your own model can be found in the [training-charRNN](https://github.com/ml5js/training-charRNN) repo. There are many complex and important ethical questions around voice, authorship, and consent when working with ML models that generate text trained off of a corpus of text. The following readings are suggested when working with the pre-trained models offered here.
